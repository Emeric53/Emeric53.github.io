# Academic

I am currently a master student at the University of Chiense academy of Sciences, focosing on methane point source detection and quantification using remote sensing techniques.

I don't think I am prety good at academic research, but I am still learning and trying my best.

## Publications

I've published an article in the *Remote Sensing*, in which I proposed a improved version of methane retrieval algorithm called matched filter based on the multi-linear approximation. The article can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/5/843).

Besides, I've also contributed to my collegues's article in the *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, in which we proposed a deep-learning architecture to detect and segment methane plume from methane retrieval products. The article can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10975006).
